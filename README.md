🎮 Gameplay Systems • AI Scripting • Player Mechanics

Hi! I’m a Technical Designer who loves building immersive, player-driven systems. I specialize in gameplay mechanics, AI behavior, and level interactions using Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (Blueprint & C++). With a Master's in Game Design and hands-on experience across multiple engines, I enjoy bridging design and code to create mechanics that feel great to play.
